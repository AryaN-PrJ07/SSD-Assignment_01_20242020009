   Used Regex Expression.
# ASSUMPTION
   Since the format of access.log will be consistent i.e POST , HTTP and status code 404 always occur in fixed order.
   Hence, Regex Expression will  generated the desired result .
   
   
# Question 2 
    Break  the line by delimiter as ',' , then trace the last column value of each column by  ($NF) and  record the total sum into variable  'sum' and show the result. 
    
# ASSUMPTION
    Taking account the fact that the format of  power_level.txt will not change  and thus last column can always by  delimiter by ',' .
